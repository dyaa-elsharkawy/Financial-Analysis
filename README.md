# Financial-Analysis
In this project, I built a Power BI dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into financial performance, designed to help the business make data-driven decisions. The dashboard includes a range of KPIs such as Revenue, Cost, Expenses, and Operating Income.

Key Features:
Revenue & Margin Analysis üìà
On this page, I used Tooltip to provide additional context on revenue and margin details. It allows for quick insights into performance metrics by month, helping users understand key trends. I also visualized revenue breakdowns by supplier and category, so it's easy to see which suppliers and product categories are driving growth.

What-If Scenario Analysis üîç
This is a powerful tool that enables users to explore different scenarios by adjusting key parameters like price, cost, and quantity. By simulating various business scenarios, stakeholders can make well-informed decisions based on potential outcomes, keeping the business agile and prepared for change.

Income Statement Overview üíº
A monthly breakdown of Operating Income trends, including increases and decreases, gives a clear picture of the financial progress over time. The dashboard also includes a table with detailed account-level insights for each month, providing visibility into operational revenue, expenses, and overhead costs. This helps in identifying cost-saving opportunities and optimizing financial performance.

Category and Team-Based Revenue Insights üîç
I included revenue analyses by sales channels (Retail, Wholesales, Online) and product categories (Food, Drinks). This segmentation makes it easy for stakeholders to see which channels and categories are performing best, allowing for data-driven strategy adjustments.

Why This Matters
With these insights, the company can strategically target growth opportunities, control costs, and improve supplier relationships. This dashboard provides a solid foundation for quick decision-making, enabling the business to be proactive and strategic in a dynamic market.
